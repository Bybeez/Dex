# Privacy Policy

This app lives primarily on the phone. When loading, offline data is used to compile the list of Pokemon 
and information about each one when clicked. 

## Downloads
Dex does use the Internet in order to download animations for each Pokemon. These requests are made anonymously to a third-party
website. No more information is sent than by opening the animation directly in a web browser.

## Play Store
This app does collect anonymous statistical data like every other app such as app version, OS version, and device language.
None of the information is enough to identify any person and it is not shared with any third parties. It is primarily used to help
target users in the app development.

## Agreement
By using this app, you agree that you've read and consent to the app and it's capabilities running on your device.
